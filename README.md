# team 15 - get[f]it

## Description of Project:

As temperatures take a dive and days become shorter, it can be difficult to motivate yourself to get outside, much less get outside and work out. Fortunately, studies show the social aspect of exercise compels us to do things we might not do otherwise. One of the best strategies for making your workout happen, no matter what the weather, is positive reinforcement and fun. Our program/game does just that in challenging ourselves and our friends to do activities.
We can make promises to ourselves all day long, but research shows weâ€™re more likely to follow through with activities when we plan them with friends.

## Installation

* git clone https://github.com/hmaguluri/GetFit.git

## Additional features if we had more time:
-Throw shine to friends in real time- send them a song or a message to encourage a friend while doing their activity. (User could also choose to receive the shine after his/her workout.)  -Snapchat-style filters and stickers to decorate post-workout brag photos.

Anyone who needs motivation to exercise, social media savvy people who like to keep in touch with friends and are encouraged by others
